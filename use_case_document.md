# FoodieSpot Conversational AI Reservation System - Use Case Document

## Project Title:
FoodieSpot Conversational AI Restaurant Reservation System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Client Background
FoodieSpot is a growing restaurant chain with multiple (currently 35 documented) locations spread across various parts of the city. They offer a diverse range of cuisines and dining experiences, catering to a broad customer base. As FoodieSpot expands, managing reservations efficiently and providing excellent customer service becomes increasingly crucial for their brand reputation and operational success.

### 1.2. Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a sophisticated Conversational AI Agent to streamline FoodieSpot's reservation management process. The AI agent will serve as an intelligent virtual assistant, capable of understanding user requests, searching for suitable restaurants, checking real-time availability, making reservations, and providing recommendations. The system will feature a user-friendly frontend (built with Streamlit) and will leverage a Large Language Model (LLM, specifically Llama-3.1-8B or similar via Groq API) with a robust tool-calling architecture for its core logic.

## 2. Business Problem & Opportunity

### 2.1. Current Challenges in Reservation Management
FoodieSpot currently faces several challenges with traditional reservation methods:
*   **High Call Volume:** Manual reservation booking via phone calls can be time-consuming for staff, especially during peak hours, leading to missed calls or long wait times for customers.
*   **Inefficient Resource Allocation:** Staff members spend significant time on routine reservation tasks, diverting them from in-person customer service and other critical operational duties.
*   **Limited Accessibility:** Customers can only make reservations during restaurant operating hours or when staff are available to take calls.
*   **Potential for Human Error:** Manual data entry for reservations can lead to errors (e.g., incorrect date, time, party size), resulting in customer dissatisfaction.
*   **Lack of Centralized Data & Insights:** Difficulty in aggregating reservation data across all locations for strategic decision-making (e.g., identifying peak demand, popular cuisines, customer preferences).
*   **Inconsistent Customer Experience:** The experience of making a reservation can vary depending on the staff member and their current workload.

### 2.2. Business Opportunities with AI Agent
The Conversational AI Agent presents significant opportunities for FoodieSpot:
*   **Enhanced Efficiency:** Automate the reservation process 24/7, reducing staff workload and operational costs associated with manual booking.

*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Offer tailored restaurant suggestions based on user preferences (cuisine, location, etc.), enhancing the discovery process.

## 3. Proposed Solution: FoodieSpot Conversational AI Agent

### 3.1. Solution Description
The proposed solution is a Conversational AI Agent that users can interact with via a simple chat interface (Streamlit frontend). The agent will understand natural language queries related to finding restaurants, checking table availability, and making reservations. It will use a set of predefined tools to interact with FoodieSpot's restaurant data and reservation system.

### 3.2. Key Features
*   **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The agent will comprehend user requests in conversational language.
*   **Restaurant Search:**
    *   Search by cuisine (e.g., "Find Italian restaurants").
    *   Search by location (e.g., "Any good places in Downtown?").
    *   Search by restaurant name (e.g., "I'd like to book at The Gourmet Place").
    *   Filter by party size/minimum capacity.
*   **Availability Checking:**
    *   Check real-time (simulated) availability for a specific restaurant, date, time, and party size.
*   **Reservation Booking:**
    *   Make a reservation if availability is confirmed.
    *   Collect necessary details: customer name, contact information.
    *   Provide a reservation confirmation (simulated).
*   **Restaurant Recommendations:** Suggest restaurants based on partial information or broader queries (e.g., "Recommend a romantic restaurant for an anniversary").
*   **Conversational Interaction:** Engage in multi-turn dialogues, ask clarifying questions, and remember context within a session.
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle situations where information is unclear, a restaurant is not found, or a slot is unavailable.

### 3.3. Technical Approach
*   **Frontend:** Streamlit for a simple, interactive web interface.
*   **Backend Logic:** Python.
*   **AI Core:** Groq API with Llama-3.1-8B (or llama3-8b-8192 model) for natural language processing and decision-making.
*   **Tool Calling Architecture:** The LLM will determine user intent and decide which tool(s) to call (e.g., `SearchRestaurantsTool`, `CheckAvailabilityTool`, `MakeReservationTool`). This will be implemented from scratch without relying on frameworks like LangChain for the core tool-calling mechanism, as per challenge requirements.
*   **Data Management:** Restaurant details and reservations will be managed in-memory using Python data structures (lists of dictionaries in [restaurant_data.py](cci:7://file:///e:/COMPUTES/projects/sarvam_agent/foodiespot_agent/restaurant_data.py:0:0-0:0)).

## 4. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** Diners and potential customers of FoodieSpot looking to make restaurant reservations conveniently.
*   **Secondary:** FoodieSpot staff who may use the system for quick lookups or to assist customers.
